  description: >-
    A XenaCompact M6SFP test chassis, using Finisar FCMJ-8521-3 RJ45 SFP's,
    was connected to one port on each of two ProCurve 2530 switches. The switches
    were connected via a matched pair of FlexOptix multimode BiDi SFP transceivers
    (S.B1312.M.DL and S.B1512.M.DL) and a single core of a 10-meter OM1 multimode fiber
    patch cable. The FlexOptix SFP's were configured using a FlexBox programmer to present
    as HP/Aruba compatible. One test stream of randomly-sized packets (between 64 and
    1512 bytes) was configured in each direction between the Xena chassis' 0/0 and 0/1 ports.
    The streams were run at 100% line rate for one hour.
